# Studier

The studier is still in development and has many bugs. This is why you have to install the latest version manually. I am very thankfull if you could report any bugs or feature requests under the issues tab in this repository.

## Installation

### 1. Install required software

To be able to host the studier locally on your machine to use it you have to have **git** and **npm** installed.
You can find the instructions to install git here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
The easiest way to install npm is to install node.js which you can find the instructions to here: https://nodejs.org/en
If you've (already) installed them than you're good to proceed to the next step.

### 2. Get the code

Run the following command to clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/lorige55/studier
```

Now navigate into the newly created directory with this command:

```
cd studier
```

### 3. Final Step

Since you have NPM installed go ahead and run this command to install the necessary NPM packages:

```
npm install
```

Now the only thing left to do is start the local server:

```
npm run dev
```

This command starts a server that allows you to host your own local web-server. You can now navigate to the address the previous command gave you and enjoy studier!

### Stay up to date!

I am constantly updating the code, fixing bugs and adding new features. I really recommend to regularly run the following command to get the latest version of the studier:

```
git pull origin Alpha
```

Make sure to run this command inside the studier directory!
