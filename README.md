# Local Installation
The studier is still in development and has many bugs. This is why you have to install the latest version manually:

### 1. Install required software
To be able to host the studier locally on your machine to use it you have to have **git** and **npm** installed.
You can find the instructions to install git here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
The easiest way to install npm is to install node.js which you can find the instructions to here: https://nodejs.org/en

If you've (already) installed them than you're good to proceed to the next step.

### 2. Clone repository
Run the following command to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/lorige55/studier
```
